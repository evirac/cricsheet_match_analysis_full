# Cricsheet Match Analysis (Synthetic Data)

This repo contains a full working pipeline built *here* with synthetic Cricsheet-like JSON data to demonstrate end-to-end functionality:
- JSON generation per format (Test/ODI/T20/IPL)
- Transformation to CSV
- SQLite database with four tables
- 20 SQL analysis queries (outputs saved to /outputs)
- 10 matplotlib EDA charts (in /visuals/plots)
